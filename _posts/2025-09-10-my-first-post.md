<h2>The Summer Before Senior Year</h2>

<p>
The summer before senior year was honestly one of the best summers of my high school career. The previous summer, I just went on vacation with my family and then pretty much rotted for the next few weeks.

On June 19, a few days before the end of school, I went to a <strong>Stray Kids concert</strong> with my friend. It was my first concert ever, so I was really excited. My friend and I had seats way in the back, but the view wasn’t bad at all. There was a thunderstorm that day, so the show was delayed, but it was still such a good experience. Not gonna lie, by the end of it I was completely done and just wanted to go home, but it’s still something I’ll never forget.

After school officially ended, I went on vacation to <strong>Fort Lauderdale, Florida</strong>, for about four days. I went to the beach multiple times and was so happy to get away from New York beaches because they’re dirrrrrtyyy. Like, look at the difference! Anyway, I got to enjoy the beach, eat some local food, and even took a day trip down to <strong>Miami</strong> to explore the food and malls there too.

A couple weeks after vacation, I started working. The minute I got there, I wanted to go home, but what kept me going was the money. It was a <strong>Cybersecurity and AI apprenticeship</strong>. I was bored most of the time, but I still think it was a valuable experience. I learned about cybersecurity, specifically network security, and even earned a <strong>Network Security Certification</strong> from Certiport. We also took a trip to Bryant Park. Later, the focus shifted to AI, and we created our own AI assistant using <strong>IBM Watson</strong>.

Work ended in mid-August, so for the rest of the summer, I was free. I rewatched and reread some of my favorite shows and books, started new ones, and just enjoyed the time off. Then, of course, I got pre-school depression for a week before senior year started.
