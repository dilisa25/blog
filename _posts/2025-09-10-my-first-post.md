    <h2>The Summer Before Senior Year</h2>

    <p>
      The summer before senior year was honestly one of the best summers of my high school career. The previous summer, I just went on vacation with my family and then pretty much rotted for the next few weeks, so this one felt like a big upgrade. It had a little bit of everything, fun, travel, work, and learning.

      It all started on June 19, a few days before school officially ended. My friend and I went to a <strong>Stray Kids concert</strong>, which was my first concert ever. We had seats way in the back, but the view wasn’t bad at all. A thunderstorm delayed the show, but once it started, it was amazing. The lights, the energy, the crowd, it all felt unreal. By the end, I was completely exhausted and ready to go home, but it’s still one of my favorite memories.

      After the concert and the last day of school, my family and I headed to <strong>Fort Lauderdale, Florida</strong>, for a short vacation. I went to the beach multiple times and was so happy to escape New York beaches, they’re dirrrrrtyyy. The water in Florida was clear and warm, and the sand didn’t feel like city dust. I got to relax, eat some local food, and even took a day trip down to <strong>Miami</strong> to check out the malls and food spots there too. It was the perfect reset before getting back to real life.

      A couple weeks after vacation, I started working at a <strong>Cybersecurity and AI apprenticeship</strong>. I’ll be honest the first day, I wanted to go home immediately. But what kept me going was the money and the experience. Even though some parts felt slow, I learned a lot about cybersecurity, specifically network security, and earned a <strong>Network Security Certification</strong> from Certiport. We also took a group trip to Bryant Park, which was a nice break from staring at screens. Later in the program, we shifted to AI and built our own AI assistant using <strong>IBM Watson</strong>. That part really made me realize how powerful and creative tech can be when you know how to use it.

      When work ended in mid-August, I finally had time to just breathe. I rewatched and reread some of my favorite shows and books, tried new ones, and caught up on sleep. It was nice to slow down after a busy summer full of new experiences. Of course, the week before school started, I got that classic pre-senior-year dread ,but honestly, it felt good knowing I made the most out of my last summer as a high schooler.

      “Looking back, that summer taught me balance. I got to experience new things, explore new places, and even take a step into the world of tech and cybersecurity. It made me realize how much I’ve grown and how ready I am to take on senior year.”
