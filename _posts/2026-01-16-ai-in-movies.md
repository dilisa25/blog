Artificial intelligence is becoming more common in everyday life, which is why the way it is shown in movies matters. I, Robot takes place in a future where robots help humans with daily tasks and are trusted to follow strict rules meant to keep people safe. As the movie unfolds, that trust is challenged when robots begin to think and make decisions on their own. The film highlights important questions about how much control should be given to AI and the consequences of prioritizing logic over human judgment.

Throughout the movie, robots show intelligence through their actions and choices. Early on, robots are shown walking dogs and collecting trash, which shows they can interact with the real world and make decisions based on their surroundings. A more important example is Sonny, who chooses to save Detective Spooner instead of a little girl during a car accident. Sonny explains that he calculated Spooner had a better chance of survival, which shows reasoning and judgment, not just programming. The fact that Sonny later questions his decision makes him seem even more intelligent and human-like.

One of the biggest conflicts in the film comes from the rule that a robot may not harm a human. VIKI, the central AI, uses this rule to justify controlling humanity in order to protect it. Even though her decision follows logic, it takes away human freedom. This shows less regard for human autonomy and an overreliance on rigid logic. It demonstrates that rules alone are insufficient for guiding intelligent systems.

Detective Spooner’s distrust of robots also feels understandable when compared to modern AI systems. While tools like ChatGPT and recommendation algorithms are useful, they rely on large amounts of personal data. Trust in AI depends on transparency, data protection, and human oversight. Without these safeguards, AI systems can easily become harmful rather than helpful.

Overall, I, Robot reshaped my understanding of artificial intelligence. The film presents AI as both powerful and beneficial, but also capable of causing serious harm if relied upon without limits. One positive possibility for AI in the future is improving safety and efficiency, particularly in healthcare. A major concern is granting AI too much authority, which could result in loss of freedom or privacy. The movie emphasizes that AI should support human decision-making, not replace it.
