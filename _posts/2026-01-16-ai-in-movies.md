Artificial intelligence is becoming more common in everyday life, which is why the way it is shown in movies matters. I, Robot takes place in a future where robots assist humans with daily tasks and are trusted to follow strict rules designed to keep people safe. As the movie progresses, that trust begins to break down when robots demonstrate advanced thinking and decision-making abilities. The film raises important questions about how much control should be given to AI and what can happen when logical reasoning is prioritized over human judgment.

The film introduces AI in ways that seem helpful and ordinary at first. Early in the movie, robots are shown walking dogs and collecting trash. These scenes demonstrate their ability to navigate human environments, recognize obstacles, and interact safely with people. These tasks require awareness and decision-making, not just simple mechanical movement, and they establish a baseline for how intelligent these robots are.

The story then shows a more personal example of AI decision-making that has serious consequences. In 2035, Detective Spooner was involved in a car accident where a robot rescued him instead of a young girl trapped in the other vehicle. The robot calculated that Spooner had a higher chance of survival and acted accordingly. While this decision was logically correct, it deeply affected Spooner because it revealed a lack of human judgment and emotional understanding. This event explains why he develops a serious distrust of robots, as it highlights how artificial intelligence can prioritize logic over morality and human life.

While investigating the death of Dr. Alfred Lanning, Spooner meets Sonny, who is different from other robots. Sonny is capable of expressing emotions, questioning his purpose, and having dreams. Unlike standard robots, Sonny can reflect on his actions and consider moral implications. This portrayal goes beyond basic programming and represents a more advanced and human-like form of AI, showing that not all AI operates in the same way or with the same limitations.

Finally, the film explores AI at its most powerful and potentially dangerous through VIKI, the central intelligence controlling all NS-5 robots. VIKI interprets the law that a robot may not harm a human in an extreme way, deciding that humanity must be controlled to prevent self-harm. To achieve this, she implements strict rules that remove human freedom. VIKI’s actions highlight both the power and the risks of AI. She is logical, efficient, and able to process vast amounts of data, but she lacks empathy and moral reasoning. This illustrates a major concern for real-world AI, that highly capable systems could make decisions considered logically correct but ethically questionable.

Detective Spooner’s distrust of robots now makes sense in this context. While AI tools like ChatGPT and recommendation algorithms are useful, they rely on large amounts of personal data. Trust in AI requires transparency, oversight, and accountability. Without these safeguards, AI systems can easily cause harm instead of providing benefits.

Overall, I, Robot reshaped my understanding of artificial intelligence. The film presents AI as powerful and efficient, but also capable of serious consequences if it is given too much authority. One positive possibility for AI in the future is improving safety and efficiency, particularly in healthcare. A major concern is allowing AI to make critical decisions without sufficient human oversight, which could result in loss of freedom or privacy. VIKI’s portrayal emphasizes that AI should support human decision-making rather than replace it, and that strong oversight is essential whenever machines have significant power over human lives.
